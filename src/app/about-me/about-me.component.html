      <p>
        Since enrolling in an <b>Information Technology</b> diploma course in
        2018, I have been honing my coding skills and steadily improving ever
        since.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have taken part and led in some hackathons, which have consistenly
        aided my learning, problem-solving, and collaborative skills. I am now
        adept at
        <b>analysing and breaking down complex tasks into smaller components</b
        >, which I can assign to my team members. Additionally, I am proficient
        in <b>effectively communicating with my team</b> to ensure success in
        achieving our goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        My primary focus these days have been developing application with
        <b>React</b> and <b>NodeJS</b>, as these technologies are preferred
        among the teams I have worked with.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, my interest prior to participating in hackathons lies in
        <b>ASP.NET back-end development</b>. My current goal is to integrate
        ASP.NET into my future projects and improve on my back-end development
        skills.
